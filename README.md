# Charitably
Charitably is an application that allows groups to collectively allocate charitable giving. Users are able to propose organizations that they would like to give to and then allocate donations from a collective giving fund.

Charitably was created as my final project for CSE-183 (Web Development) in Spring of 2021 while attending The University of California Sata Cruz.
